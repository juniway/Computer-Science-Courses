Book
Assignments and Solutions
CS5412 Cloud Computing Cornell University
Taught by one of the stalwarts of this field, Prof Ken Birman, this course has a fantastic set of slides that one can go through. The Prof's book is also a gem and recommended as a must read in Google's tutorial on Distributed System Design
Slides
CSCI 360 Computer Architecture 3 CUNY Hunter College
A course that covers cache design, buses, memory hierarchies, processor-peripheral interfaces, and multiprocessors, including GPUs.
CSCI 493.66 UNIX System Programming (formerly UNIX Tools) CUNY Hunter College
A course that is mostly about writing programs against the UNIX API, covering all of the basic parts of the kernel interface and libraries, including files, processes, terminal control, signals, and threading.
CSCI 493.75 Parallel Computing CUNY Hunter College
The course is an introduction to parallel algorithms and parallel programming in C and C++, using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and the OpenMP application programming interface. It also includes a brief introduction to parallel architectures and interconnection networks. It is both theoretical and practical, including material on design methodology, performance analysis, and mathematical concepts, as well as details on programming using MPI and OpenMP.
Programming Languages / Compilers

COS326 Functional Programming Princeton University
Covers functional programming concepts like closures, tail-call recursion & parallelism using the OCaml programming language
Lectures
Assignments
CIS194 Introduction to Haskell Penn Engineering
Explore the joys of functional programming, using Haskell as a vehicle. The aim of the course will be to allow you to use Haskell to easily and conveniently write practical programs.
Previous semester also available, with more exercices

Code for Assignments
CS3110 Data Structures and Functional Programming Cornell University
Another course that uses OCaml to teach alternative programming paradigms, especially functional and concurrent programming.
Lecture Slides
Assignments
CS173 Programming Languages Brown University
Course by Prof. Krishnamurthi (author of HtDP) and numerous other awesome books on programming languages. Uses a custom designed Pyret programming language to teach the concepts. There was an online class hosted in 2012, which includes all lecture videos for you to enjoy.

Assignments
Algorithms

COS226 Data Structures and Algorithms Princeton University
The popular algorithms class covering most important algorithms and data structures in use on computers taught by Robert Sedgewick.
Assignments
CS61B Data Structures Berkeley
In this course, you will study advanced programming techniques including data structures, encapsulation, abstract data types, interfaces, and algorithms for sorting and searching, and you will get a taste of “software engineering”—the design and implementation of large programs.
Labs

- CSCI 235 Software Design and Analysis II CUNY Hunter College
Introduces algorithms for a few common problems such as sorting. Practically speaking, it furthers the students' programming skills with topics such as recursion, pointers, and exception handling, and provides a chance to improve software engineering skills and to give the students practical experience for more productive programming.
CSCI 335 Software Design and Analysis III CUNY Hunter College
This includes the introduction of hashes, heaps, various forms of trees, and graphs. It also revisits recursion and the sorting problem from a higher perspective than was presented in the prequels. On top of this, it is intended to introduce methods of algorithmic analysis.
Misc

CS 5150 Software Engineering Cornell University
Introduction to the practical problems of specifying, designing, building, testing, and delivering reliable software systems
Lectures
15-781 Machine Learning Carnegie Mellon University
Taught by one of the leading experts on Machine Learning - Tom Mitchell
Lectures
Project Ideas and Datasets
ESM 296-4F GIS & Spatial Analysis UC Santa Barbara
Taught by James Frew, Ben Best, and Lisa Wedding
Focuses on specific computational languages (e.g., Python, R, shell) and tools (e.g., GDAL/OGR, InVEST, MGET, ModelBuilder) applied to the spatial analysis of environmental problems
